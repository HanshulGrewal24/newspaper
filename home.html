                <p>In June, a vacation bench in the high court directed the UT Department of Sports to issue the necessary sports gradation certificate to Manraj Singh Chatha. The Supreme Court on Friday affirmed the grant of a sports gradation certificate to a shooter for enabling him to pursue a five-year law degree course, even as it advised him with a touch of humour, “At least become a good lawyer now. And do not use a rifle when you practise law.” The comments from a bench of justices Bhushan R Gavai and KV Viswanathan came as it refused to interfere with the Punjab and Haryana high court’s decision, which had declared the denial of a sports gradation certificate to Manraj Singh Chatha as “unjust, unfair, arbitrary, and irrational.”The bench refused to interfere with the high court’s June judgment that granted relief to Chatha, though it clarified that this judgment would not serve as a judicial precedent. </p>
